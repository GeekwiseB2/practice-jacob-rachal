        <h3>Hello, my name is Jacob Rachal. I am a recent graduate from Fresno State with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.</h3>
        <h3>At the moment, I am looking for and applying to jobs that will help me gain more computer experience, and/or work experience in general.</h3>
        <h5>(Which, by the way, has been slow going. Good grief, is job hunting always like this?)</h5>
        <h3>But I'm getting off track.  The reason why I started taking classes with GEEKWISE is a multi-part answer:</h3>
        <h3>1. Some people that I trust suggested that I should check out what you have to offer while I am employment hunting.</h3>
        <h3>2. I have felt that, while my colledge education has been great in many respects, it has been somewhat lacking in areas.  I believe that GEEKWISE will help fill in the gaps. </h3>
        <!-- What this Ryeker said:<h3>I am awesome. Let me just get that out there now. Now that you know that, your life is better. You're welcome.</h3> -->
